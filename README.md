Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network with Choquet Layer for Matlab

This work is on Mex with Matlab

1-Exponential Linear Units for Hidden Layers

2-Tanh for output layer

3-Cosine annealing warm-restart procedure for learning rate. It uses validation set for deterimining best weights. After epoches finished, you can test your model with test dataset.

4-Weight calculations are programmed with C on Mex like backpropagation.
